C++20 added support for coroutines that can improve the experience
writing asynchronous code. C++26 added the sender/receiver model
for a general interface to asynchronous operations. The expectation
is that users would use the framework using some coroutine type. To
support that, a suitable class needs to be defined and this proposal
is providing such a definition.

Just to get an idea what this proposal is about: here is a simple
`Hello, world` written using the proposed coroutine type:

```c++
#include <execution>
#include <iostream>
#include <task>

namespace ex = std::execution;

int main() {
    return std::get<0>(*ex::sync_wait([]->ex::task<int> {
        std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
        co_return co_await ex::just(0);
    }()));
}
```

# Change History

## R0 Initial Revision

## R1 Hagenberg Feedback

- Changed the name from `lazy` to `task` based on SG1 feedback and
  dropped the section on why `lazy` was chosen.
- Changed the name of `any_scheduler` to `task_scheduler`.
- Added wording for the `task` specification.

## R2 LEWG Feedback

- Removed the use `decay_t` from the specification.
- Changed the wording to avoid `exception_ptr` when unavailable.
- Renamed `Context` to `Environment` to better reflect the argument's use.
- Made exposition-only "macros" use italics.
- Added a feature test macro.
- Fixed some typos.

# Prior Work

This proposal isn't the first to propose a coroutine type. Prior proposals
didn't see any recent (post introduction of sender/receiver) update, although
corresponding proposals were discussed informally on multiple occasions.
There are also implementations of coroutine types based on a sender/receiver
model in active use. This section provides an overview of this prior work,
and where relevant, of corresponding discussions. This section is primarily
for motivating requirements and describing some points in the design space.

## [P1056](https://wg21.link/P1056): Add lazy coroutine (coroutine task) type

The paper describes a `task`/`lazy` type (in
[P1056r0](https://wg21.link/P1056r0) the name was `task`; the primary
change for [P1056r1](https://wg21.link/P1056r1) is changing the
name to `lazy`). The fundamental idea is to have a coroutine type
which can be `co_await`ed: the interface of `lazy` consists of move
constructor, deliberately no move assignment, a destructor, and
`operator co_await()`. The proposals don't go into much detail
on how to eventually use a coroutine, but it mentions that there could
be functions like `sync_await(task<To>)` to await completion of a
task (similar to
[`execution::sync_wait(sender)`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.sync.wait))
or a few variations of that.

A fair part of the paper argues why `future.then()` is _not_ a good
approach to model coroutines and their results. Using `future`
requires allocation, synchronisation, reference counting, and
scheduling which can all be avoided when using coroutines in a
structured way.

The paper also mentions support for [symmetric
transfer](https://wg21.link/P0913) and allocator support. Both of these
are details on how the coroutine is implemented.

[Discussion for P1056r0 in SG1](https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21rapperswil2018/P1056R0)

- The task doesn't really have anything to do with concurrency.
- Decomposing a task cheaply is fundamental. The
  [HALO Optimisations](https://wg21.link/P0981R0) help.
- The `task` isn't move assignable because there are better approaches
  than using containers to hold them. It is move constructible as there
  are no issues with overwriting a potentially live task.
- Resuming where things complete is unsafe but the task didn't want to
  impose any overhead on everybody.
- There can be more than one `task` type for different needs.
- Holding a mutex lock while `co_await`ing which may resume on a different
  thread is hazardous. Static analysers should be able to detect these cases.
- Votes confirmed the no move assignment and forwarding to LEWG assuming
  the name is not `task`.
- Votes against deal with associated executors and a request to have
  strong language about transfer between threads.

## [P2506](https://wg21.link/P2506): std::lazy: a coroutine for deferred execution

This paper is effectively restating what [P1056](https://wg21.link/P1056)
said with the primary change being more complete proposed wording.
Although sender/receiver were discussed when the paper was written
but [`std::execution`](https://wg21.link/P2300) hadn't made it into
the working paper, the proposal did _not_ take a sender/receiver
interface into account.

Although there were mails seemingly scheduling a discussion in LEWG,
we didn't manage to actually locate any discussion notes.

## [cppcoro](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro)

This library contains multiple coroutine types, algorithms, and
some facilities for asynchronous work. For the purpose of this
discussion only the task types are of interest. There are two task
types
[`cppcoro::task`](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro?tab=readme-ov-file#taskt)
and
[`cppcoro::shared_task`](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro?tab=readme-ov-file#shared_taskt).
The key difference between `task` and `shared_task` is that the
latter can be copied and awaited by multiple other coroutines. As
a result `shared_task` always produces an lvalue and may have
slightly higher costs due to the need to maintain a reference count.

The types and algorithms are pre-sender/receiver and operate entirely
in terms for awaiters/awaitables. The interface of both task types
is a bit richer than that from
[P1056](https://wg21.link/P1056)/[P2506](https://wg21.link/P2506). Below
`t` is either a `cppcoro::task<T>` or a `cppcoro::shared_task<T>`:

- The task objects can be move constructed and move assigned; `shared_task<T>`
  object can also be copy constructed and copy assigned.
- Using `t.is_ready()` it can be queried if `t` has completed.
- Using `co_await t` awaits completion of `t`, yielding the result. The result
  may be throwing an exception if the coroutine completed by throwing.
- Using `co_await t.when_ready()` allows synchronising with the completion of
  `t` without actually getting the result. This form of synchronisation won't
  throw any exception.
- `cpproro::shared_task<T>` also supports equality comparisons.

In both cases, the task starts suspended and is resumed when it is
`co_await`ed.  This way a continuation is known when the task is
resumed, which is similar to `start(op)`ing an operation state `op`.
The coroutine body needs to use `co_await` or `co_return`. `co_await`
expects an awaitable or an awaiter as argument. Using `co_yield`
is not supported. The implementation supports symmetric transfer but
doesn't mention allocators.

The `shared_task<T>` is similar to
[`split(sender)`](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.split): in both cases,
the same result is produced for multiple consumers. Correspondingly,
there isn't a need to support a separate `shared_task<T>` in a
sender/receiver world. Likewise, throwing of results can be avoid
by suitably rewriting the result of the `set_error` channel avoiding
the need for an operation akin to `when_ready()`.

## [libunifex](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex)

`unifex` is an earlier implementation of the sender/receiver
ideas. Compared to `std::execution` it is lacking some of the
flexibilities. For example, it doesn't have a concept of environments
or domains. However, the fundamental idea of three completion
channels for success, failure, and cancellation and the general
shape of how these are used is present (even using the same names
for `set_value` and `set_error`; the equivalent of `set_stopped`
is called `set_done`). `unifex` is in production use in multiple
places. The implementation includes a
[`unifex::task<T>`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex/blob/main/include/unifex/task.hpp).

As `unifex` is sender/receiver-based, its `unifex::task<T>` is
implemented such that `co_await` can deal with senders in addition
to awaitables or awaiters. Also, `unifex::task<T>` is _scheduler
affine_: the coroutine code resumes on the same scheduler even if a
sender completed on a different scheduler. The task's scheduler
is taken from the receiver it is `connect`ed to.  The exception for
rescheduling on the task's scheduler is explicitly awaiting the
result of `schedule(sched)` for some scheduler `sched`: the operation
changes the task's scheduler to be `sched`.  The relevant treatment
is in the promise type's `await_transform()`:

- If a sender `sndr` which is the result of `schedule(sched)` is
  `co_await`ed, the corresponding `sched` is installed as the task's
  scheduler and the task resumes on the context completing `sndr`.
  Feedback from people working with unifex suggests that this choice
  for changing the scheduler is too subtle. While it is considered
  important to be able to explicitly change the scheduler a task
  executes on, doing so should be more explicit.
- For both senders and awaiters being awaited, the coroutine
  will be resumed on the task's current scheduler when the task is
  scheduler affine. In general that is done by continuing with the
  senders result on the task's scheduler, similar to `continues_on(sender,
  scheduler)`. The rescheduling is avoided when the sender is tagged
  as not changing scheduler (using a `static constexpr` member named
  `blocking` which is initialised to `blocking_kind::always_inline`).
- If a sender is `co_await`ed it gets `connect`ed to a receiver
  provided by the task to form an awaiter holding an operation
  state. The operation state gets `start`ed by the awaiter's
  `await_suspend`. The receiver arranges for a `set_value` completion
  to become a value returned from `await_resume`, a `set_error`
  completion to become an exception, and a `set_done` completion
  to resume a special "on done" coroutine handle rather than resuming
  the task itself effectively behaving like an uncatchable exception
  (all relevant state is properly destroyed and the coroutine is
  never resumed).

When `co_await`ing a sender `sndr` there can be at most one `set_value`
completion: if there are more than one `set_value` completions the
promise type's `await_transform` will just return `sndr` and the
result cannot be `co_await`ed (unless it is also given an awaitable
interface). The result type of `co_await sndr` depends on the number
of arguments to `set_value`:

- If there are no arguments for `set_value` then the type of `co_await sndr`
    will be `void`.
- If there is exactly one argument of type `T` for `set_value`
    then the type of `co_await sndr` will be `T`.
- If there are more than one arguments for `set_value` then
    the type of `co_await sndr` will be `std::tuple<T1, T2, ...>`
    with the corresponding argument types.

If a receiver doesn't have a scheduler, it can't be `connect()`ed
to a `unifex::task<T>`. In particular, when using a `unifex::async_scope
scope` it isn't possible to directly call `scope.spawn(task)` with
a `unifex::task<T> task` as the `unifex::async_scope` doesn't provide
a scheduler. The `unifex::async_scope` provides a few variations
of `spawn()` which take a scheduler as argument.

`unifex` provides some sender algorithms to transform the sender
result into something which may be more suitable to be `co_await`ed.
For example, `unifex::done_as_optional(sender)` turns a successful
completion for a type `T` into an `std::optional<T>` and the
cancellation completion `set_done` into a `set_value` completion
with a disengaged `std::optional<T>`.

The `unifex::task<T>` is itself a sender and can be used correspondingly.
To deal with scheduler affinity a type erased scheduler
`unifex::any_scheduler` is used.

The `unifex::task<T>` doesn't have allocator support. When creating
a task multiple objects are allocated on the heap: it seems there
is a total of 6 allocations for each `unifex::task<T>` being created.
After that, it seems the different `co_await`s don't use a separate
allocation.

The `unifex::task<T>` doesn't directly guard against stack overflow.
Due to rescheduling continuations on a scheduler when the completion
isn't always inline, the issue only arises when `co_await`ing many
senders with `blocking_kind::always_inline` or when the scheduler
resumes inline.

## [stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec)

The
[`exec::task`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec/blob/main/include/exec/task.hpp)
in stdexec is somewhat similar to the unifex task with some choices
being different, though:

- The `exec::task<T, C>` is also scheduler affine. The chosen scheduler
    is unconditionally used for every `co_await`, i.e., there is no
    attempt made to avoid scheduling, e.g., when the `co_await`ed sender
    completes inline.
- Unlike unifex, it is OK if the receiver's environment doesn't provide
    a scheduler. In that case an inline scheduler is used. If an inline
    scheduler is used there is the possibility of stack overflow.
- It is possible to `co_await just_error(e)` and `co_await just_stopped()`,
    i.e., the sender isn't required to have a `set_value_t` completion.

The `exec::task<T, C>` also provides a _context_ `C`. An object of
this type becomes the environment for receivers `connect()`ed to
`co_await`ed senders. The default context provides access to the
task's scheduler. In addition an `in_place_stop_token` is provides
which forwards the stop requests from the environment of the receiver
which is connected to the task.

Like the unifex task `exec::task<T, C>` doesn't provide any allocator
support. When creating a task there are two allocations.

# Objectives

Also see [sender/receiver issue 241](https://github.com/cplusplus/sender-receiver/issues/241).

Based on the prior work and discussions around corresponding coroutine
support there is a number of required or desired features (listed in
no particular order):

1. A coroutine task needs to be awaiter/awaitable friendly, i.e., it
    should be possibly to `co_await` awaitables which includes both
    library provided and user provided ones. While that seems
    obvious, it is possible to create an `await_transform` which
    is deleted for awaiters and that should be prohibited.
2. When composing sender algorithms without using a coroutine it
    is common to adapt the results using suitable algorithms and
    the completions for sender algorithms are designed accordingly.
    On the other hand, when awaiting senders in a coroutine it may
    be considered annoying having to transform the result into a
    shape which is friendly to a coroutine use. Thus, it may be
    reasonable to support rewriting certain shapes of completion
    signatures into something different to make the use of senders
    easier in a coroutine task. See the section on the
    [result type for `co_await`](#result-type-for-co_await) for a
    discussion.

3. A coroutine task needs to be sender friendly: it is expected that
    asynchronous code is often written using coroutines awaiting
    senders. However, depending on how senders are treated by a
    coroutine some senders may not be awaitable. For example neither
    unifex nor stdexec support `co_await`ing senders with more than
    one `set_value` completion.
4. It is possibly confusing and problematic if coroutines resume on
    a different execution context than the one they were suspended
    on: the textual similarity to normal functions makes it look
    as if things are executed sequentially. Experience also indicates
    that continuing a coroutine on whatever context a `co_await`ed
    operation completes frequently leads to issues. Senders could,
    however, complete on an entirely different scheduler than where
    they started. When composing senders (not using coroutines)
    changing contexts is probably OK because it is done deliberately,
    e.g., using `continues_on`, and the way to express things is
    new with fewer attached expectations.

    To bring these two views
    together a coroutine task should be scheduler affine by default,
    i.e., it should normally resume on the same scheduler. There
    should probably also be an explicit way to opt out of scheduler
    affinity when the implications are well understood.

    Note that scheduler affinity does _not_ mean that a task is
    always continuing on the same thread: a scheduler may refer to
    a thread pool and the task will continue on one of the threads
    (which also means that thread local storage cannot be used to
    propagate contexts implicitly; see the [discussion on environments](#environment-support)
    below).
5. When using coroutines there will probably be an allocation at
    least for the coroutine frame (the [HALO optimisations](https://wg21.link/P0981R0)
    can't always work). To support the use in environments
    where memory allocations using `new`/`delete` aren't supported
    the coroutine task should support allocations using allocators.
6. Receivers have associated environments which can support an open
    set of queries. Normally, queries on an environment can be
    forwarded to the environment of a `connect()`ed receiver.
    Since the coroutine types are determined before the coroutine's
    receiver is known and the queries themselves don't specify a
    result type that isn't possible when a coroutine provides a
    receiver to a sender in a `co_await` expression. It should still
    be possible to provide a user-customisable environment from the
    receiver used by `co_await` expressions. One aspect of this
    environment is to forward stop requests to `co_await`ed child
    operations. Another is possibly changing the scheduler to be
    used when a child operation queries `get_scheduler` from the
    receiver's environment. Also, in non-asynchronous code it is
    quite common to pass some form of context implicitly using
    thread local storage. In an asynchronous world such contexts
    could be forwarded using the environment.
7. The coroutine should be able to indicate that it was canceled,
    i.e., to get `set_stopped()` called on the task's receiver.
    `std::execution::with_awaitable_senders` already provided this
    ability senders being `co_await`ed but that doesn't necessarily
    extend to the coroutine implementation.
8. Similar to indicating that a task got canceled it would be good
    if a task could indicate that an error occurred without throwing
    an exception which escapes from the coroutine.
9. In general a task has to assume that an exception escapes the
    coroutine implementation. As a result, the task's completion
    signatures need to include `set_error_t(std::exception_ptr)`.
    If it can be indicated to the task that no exception will escape
    the coroutine, this completion signature can be avoided.
10. When many `co_await`ed operations complete synchronously, there
    is a chance for stack overflow. It may be reasonable to have
    the implementation prevent stack overflow by using a suitable
    scheduler sometimes.
11. In some situations it can be useful to somehow schedule an
    asynchronous clean-up operation which is triggered upon
    coroutine exit. See the section on [asynchronous clean-up](#asynchronous-clean-up)
    below for more discussing
12. The `task` coroutine provided by the standard library may
    not always fit user's needs although they may need/want various
    of the facilities. To avoid having users implement all functionality
    from scratch `task` should use specified components which can
    be used by users when building their own coroutine. The components
    `as_awaitable` and `with_awaitable_sender` are two parts of
    achieving this objective but there are likely others.

    The algorithm `std::execution::as_awaitable` does turn a sender
    into an awaitable and is expected to be used by custom written
    coroutines. Likewise, it is intended that custom coroutines use
    the CRTP class template `std::execution::with_awaitable_senders`.
    It may be reasonable to adjust the functionality of these
    components instead of defining the functionality specific to a
    `task<...>` coroutine task.

It is important to note that different coroutine task implementations
can live side by side: not all functionality has to be implemented
by the same coroutine task. The objective for this proposal is to
select a set of features which provides a coroutine task suitable
for most uses. It may also be reasonable to provide some variations
as different names. A future revision of the standard or third party
libraries can also provide additional variations.

# Design

This section discusses various design options for achieving the
listed objectives. Most of the designs are independent of each other
and can be left out if the consensus is that it shouldn't be used
for whatever reason.

## Template Declaration for `task`

Coroutines can use `co_return` to produce a value. The value returned can
reasonably provide the argument for the `set_value_t` completion
of the coroutines. As the type of a coroutine is defined even before
the coroutine body is given, there is no way to deduce the result
type. The result type is probably the primary customisation and
should be the first template parameter which gets defaulted to
`void` for coroutines not producing any value. For example:

```c++
int main() {
    ex::sync_wait([]->ex::task<>{
        int result = co_await []->ex::task<int> { co_return 42; }();
        assert(result == 42);
    }());
}
```

The inner coroutines completes with `set_value_t(int)` which gets
translated to the value returned from `co_await` (see [`co_await`
result type below](#result-type-for-co_await) for more details).
The outer coroutine completes with `set_value_t()`.

Beyond the result type there are a number of features for a coroutine
task which benefit from customisation or for which it may be desirable
to disable them because they introduce a cost. As many template
parameters become unwieldy, it makes sense to combine these into a
[defaulted] context parameter. The aspects which benefit from
customisation are at least:

- [Customising the environment](#environment-support) for child
    operations. The context itself can actually become part of
    the environment.
- Disable [scheduler affinity](#scheduler-affinity) and/or configure
    the strategy for obtaining the coroutine's scheduler.
- Configure [allocator awareness](#allocator-support).
- Indicate that the coroutine should be [noexcept](#error-reporting).
- Define [additional error types](#error-reporting).

The default context should be used such that any empty type provides
the default behaviour instead of requiring a lot of boilerplate just
to configure a particular aspect. For example, it should be possible
to selectively enable [allocator support](#allocator-support) using
something like this:

```c++
struct allocator_aware_context {
    using allocator_type = std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>;
};
template <class T>
using my_task = ex::task<T, allocator_aware_context>;
```

Using various different types for task coroutines isn't a problem
as the corresponding objects normally don't show up in containers.
Tasks are mostly `co_await`ed by other tasks, used as child senders
when composing work graphs, or maintained until completed using
something like a [`counting_scope`](https://wg21.link/p3149). When
they are used in a container, e.g., to process data using a range
of coroutines, they are likely to use the same result type and
context types for configurations.

## `task` Completion Signatures

The discussion above established that `task<T, C>` can have a
successful completion using `set_value_t(T)`. The coroutine completes
accordingly when it is exited using a matching `co_return`. When
`T` is `void` the coroutine also completes successfully using
`set_value()` when floating off the end of the coroutine or when
using a `co_return` without an expression.

If a coroutine exits with an exception completing the corresponding
operation with `set_error(std::exception_ptr)` is an obvious choice.
Note that a `co_await` expression results in throwing an exception
when the awaited operation completes with `set_error(E)`
([see below](#result-type-for-co_await)), i.e., the coroutine itself
doesn't necessarily need to `throw` an exception itself.

Finally, a `co_await` expression completing with `set_stoppped()`
results in aborting the coroutine immediately
([see below](#result-type-for-co_await)) and causing the coroutine
itself to also complete with `set_stopped()`.

The coroutine implementation cannot inspect the coroutine body to
determine how the different asynchronous operations may complete. As
a result, the default completion signatures for `task<T>` are

```c++
ex::completion_signatures<
    ex::set_value_t(T),  // or ex::set_value_t() if T == void
    ex::set_error_t(std::exception_ptr),
    ex:set_stopped_t()
>;
```

Support for [reporting an error without exception](#error-reporting)
may modify the completion signatures.

## `task` constructors and assignments

Coroutines are created via a factory function which returns the
coroutine type and whose body uses one of the `co_*` function, e.g.

```c++
task<> nothing(){ co_return; }
```

The actual object is created via the promise type's `get_return_object`
function and it is between the promise and coroutine types how
that actually works: this constructor is an implementation detail.
To be valid senders the coroutine type needs to be destructible and it
needs to have a move constructor. Other than that, constructors and
assignments either don't make sense or enable dangerous practices:

1. Copy constructor and copy assignment don't make sense because there
    is no way to copy the actual coroutine state.
2. Move assignment is rather questionable because it makes it easy to
    transport the coroutine away from referenced entities.

    Previous papers [P1056](https://wg21.link/p1056) and
    [P2506](https://wg21.link/p2506) also argued against a move
    assignment. However, one of the arguments doesn't apply to the
    `task` proposed here: There is no need to deal with cancellation
    when assigning or destroying a `task` object. Upon `start()`
    of `task` the coroutine handle is transferred to an operation
    state and the original coroutine object doesn't have any
    reference to the object anymore.
3. If there is no assignment, a default constructed object doesn't make
    much sense, i.e., `task` also doesn't have a default constructor.

Based on experience with [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly)
the suggestion was even stronger: `task` shouldn't even have move
construction! That would mean that `task` can't be a sender or that
there would need to be some internal interface enabling the necessary
transfer. That direction isn't pursued by this proposal.

The lack of move assignment doesn't mean that `task` can't be held
in a container: it is perfectly fine to `push_back` objects of this
type into a container, e.g.:

```c++
std::vector<ex::task<>> cont;
cont.emplace_back([]->ex::task<> { co_return; }());
cont.push_back([]->ex::task<> { co_return; }());
```

The expectation is that most of the time coroutines don't end up
in normal containers. Instead, they'd be managed by a
[`counting_scope`](https://wg21.link/p3149) or hold on to by objects
in a work graph composed of senders.

Technically there isn't a problem adding a default constructor, move
assignment, and a `swap()` function. Based on experience with similar
components it seems `task` is better off not having them.

## Result Type For `co_await`

When `co_await`ing a sender `sndr` in a coroutine, `sndr` needs to
be transformed to an awaitable. The existing approach is to use
`execution::as_waitable(sndr)` [[exex.as.awaitable]](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec.as.awaitable)
in the promise type's `await_transform` and `task` uses that approach.
The awaitable returned from `as_awaitable(sndr)` has the following
behaviour (`rcvr` is the receiver the sender `sndr` is connected to):

1. When `sndr` completes with `set_stopped(std::move(rcvr))` the function `unhandled_stopped()`
    on the promise type is called and the awaiting coroutine is never
    resumed. The `unhandled_stopped()` results in `task` itself
    also completing with `set_stopped_t()`.
2. When `sndr` completes with `set_error(std::move(rcvr), error)` the coroutine is resumed
    and the `co_await sndr` expression results in `error` being thrown as an
    exceptions (with special treatment for `std::error_code`).
3. When `sndr` completes with `set_value(std::move(rcvr), a...)` the expression `co_await sndr`
    produces a result corresponding the arguments to `set_value`:

    1. If the argument list is empty, the result of `co_await sndr` is `void`.
    2. Otherwise, if the argument list contains exactly one element the result of `co_await sndr` is `a...`.
    3. Otherwise, the result of `co_await sndr` is `std::tuple(a...)`.

Note that the sender `sndr` is allowed to have no `set_value_t`
completion signatures.  In this case the result type of the awaitable
returned from `as_awaitable(sndr)` is declared to be `void` but
`co_await sndr` would never return normally: the only ways to
complete without a `set_value_t` completion is to complete with
`set_stopped(std::move(rcvr)` or with `set_error(std::move(rcvr),
error)`, i.e., the expression either results in the coroutine to
be never resumed or an exception being thrown.

Here is an example which summarises the different supported result types:

```c++
task<> fun() {
    co_await ex::just();                               // void
    auto v = co_await ex::just(0);                     // int
    auto[i, b, c] = co_await ex::just(0, true, 'c');   // tuple<int, bool, char>
    try { co_await ex::just_error(0); } catch (int) {} // exception
    co_await ex::just_stopped();                       // cancel: never resumed
}
```

The sender `sndr` can have at most one `set_value_t` completion
signature: if there are more than one `set_value_t` completion
signatures `as_awaitable(sndr)` is invalid and fails to compile: users
who want to `co_await` a sender with more than one `set_value_t`
completions need to use `co_await into_variant(s)` (or similar) to
transform the completion signatures appropriately. It would be possible
to move this transformation into `as_awaitable(sndr)`.

Using effectively `into_variant(s)` isn't the only possible
transformation if there are multiple `set_value_t` transformations.
To avoid creating a fairly hard to use result object, `as_awaitable(sndr)`
could detect certain usage patterns and rather create a result which
is easier to use when being `co_await`ed. An example for this
situation is the `queue.async_pop()` operation for [concurrent
queues](https://wg21.link/P0260): this operation can complete
successfully in two ways:

1. When an object was extracted the operation completes with `set_value(std::move(rcvr), value)`.
2. When the queue was closed the operation completes with `set_value(std::move(rcvr))`.

Turning the result of `queue.async_pop()` into an awaitable
using the current `as_awaitable(queue.async_pop())`
([[exec.as.awaitable](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec#as.awaitable)])
fails because the function accepts only senders with at most
one `set_value_t` completion. Thus, it is necessary to use something
like the below:

```c++
task<> pop_demo(auto& queue) {
    // auto value = co_await queue.async_pop(); // doesn't work
    std::optional v0 = co_await (queue.async_pop() | into_optional);
    std::optional v1 = co_await into_optional(queue.async_pop());
}
```

The algorithm `into_optional(sndr)` would determine that there is
exactly one `set_value_t` completion with arguments and produce an
`std::optional<T>` if there is just one parameter of type `T` and
produce a `std::optional<std::tuple<T...>>` if there are more than
one parameter with types `T...`. It would be possible to apply this
transformation when a corresponding set of completions is detected.
The proposal [optional variants in sender/receiver](https://wg21.link/P3570)
goes into this direction.

This proposal currently doesn't propose a change to `as_awaitable`
([[exec.as.awaitable](https://eel.is/c++draft/exec#as.awaitable)]).
The primary reason is that there are likely many different shapes
of completions each with a different desirable transformation. If
these are all absorbed into `as_awaitable` it is likely fairly hard
to reason what exact result is returned. Also, there are likely
different options of how a result could be transformed: `into_optional`
is just one example. It could be preferable to turn the two results
into an `std::expected` instead. However, there should probably be
some transformation algorithms like `into_optional`, `into_expected`,
etc.  similar to `into_variant`.

## Scheduler Affinity

Coroutines look very similar to synchronous code with a few
`co`-keywords sprinkled over the code. When reading such code the
expectation is typically that all code executes on the same context
despite some `co_await` expressions using senders which may explicitly
change the scheduler. There are various issues when using `co_await`
naïvely:

- Users may expect that work continues on the same context where it
    was started. If the coroutine simply resumes when the `co_await`ed
    senders calls a completion function code may execute some lengthy
    operation on a context which is expected to keep a UI responsive
    or which is meant to deal with I/O.
- Conversely, running a loop `co_await`ing some work may be seen as
    unproblematic but may actually easily cause a stack overflow if
    `co_await`ed work immediately completes (also
    [see below](#avoiding-stack-overflow)).
- When `co_await`ing some work completes on a different context and
    later a blocking call is made from the coroutine which also
    ends up `co_await`ing some work from the same resource there
    can be a dead lock.

Thus, the execution should normally be scheduled on the original
scheduler: doing so can avoid the problems mentioned above (assuming
a scheduler is used which doesn't immediately complete without
actually scheduling anything). This transfer of the execution with
a coroutine is referred to as _scheduler affinity_.  Note: a scheduler
may execute on multiple threads, e.g., for a pool scheduler: execution
would get to any of these threads, i.e., thread local storage is
_not_ guaranteed to access the same data even with scheduler affinity.
Also, scheduling work has some cost even if this cost can often be
fairly small.

The basic idea for scheduler affinity consists of a few parts:

1. A scheduler is determined when `start`ing an operation state
    which resulted from `connect`ing a coroutine to a receiver.
    This scheduler is used to resume execution of the coroutine.
    The scheduler is determined based on the receiver `rcvr`'s
    environment.

    ```c++
    auto scheduler = get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr));
    ```

2. The type of `scheduler` is unknown when the coroutine is created.
    Thus, the coroutine implementation needs to operate in terms
    of a scheduler with a known type which can be constructed from
    `scheduler`. The used scheduler type is determined based on the
    context parameter `C` of the coroutine type `task<T, C>` using
    `typename C::scheduler_type` and defaults to `task_scheduler`
    if this type isn't defined. `task_scheduler` uses type-erasure
    to deal with arbitrary schedulers (and small object optimisations
    to avoid allocations). The used scheduler type can be parameterised
    to allow use of `task` contexts where the scheduler type is
    known, e.g., to avoid the costs of type erasure.

    Originally `task_scheduler` was called `any_scheduler` but there
    was feedback from SG1 suggesting that a general `any_scheduler`
    may need to cover various additional properties. To avoid dealing
    with generalizing the facility a different name is used. The
    name remains specified as it is still a useful component, at
    least until an `any_scheduler` is defined by the standard
    library. If necessary, the type erased scheduler type used by
    `task` can be unspecified.

3. When an operation which is `co_await`ed completes the execution
     is transferred to the held scheduler using `continues_on`.
     Injecting this operation into the graph can be done in the
     promise type's `await_transform`:

    ```c++
    template <ex::sender Sender>
    auto await_transform(Sender&& sndr) noexcept {
        return ex::as_awaitable_sender(
            ex::continues_on(std::forward<Sender>(sndr),
                             this->scheduler);
        );
    }
    ```

There are a few immediate issues with the basic idea:

1. What should happen if there is no scheduler, i.e.,
    `get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr))` doesn't exist?
2. What should happen if the obtained `scheduler` is incompatible with
    the coroutine's scheduler?
3. Scheduling isn't free and despite the potential problems it should
    be possible to use `task` without scheduler affinity.
4. When operations are known to complete inline the scheduler isn't
    actually changed and the scheduling operation should be avoided.
5. It should be possible to explicitly change the scheduler used by
    a coroutine from within this coroutine.

All of these issues can be addressed although there are different
choices in some of these cases.

In many cases the receiver can provide access to a scheduler via
the environment query. An example where no scheduler is available
is when starting a task on a [`counting_scope`](https://wg21.link/p3149).
The scope doesn't know about any schedulers and, thus, the receiver
used by `counting_scope` when `connect`ing to a sender doesn't
support the `get_scheduler` query, i.e., this example doesn't work:

```c++
ex::spawn([]->ex::task<void> { co_await ex::just(); }(), token);
```

Using `spawn()` with coroutines doing the actual work is expected
to be quite common, i.e., it isn't just a theoretical possibility that
`task` is used together with `counting_scope`.  The approach used by
[`unifex`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex) is
to fail compilation when trying to `connect` a `Task` to a receiver
without a scheduler. The approach taken by
[`stdexec`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec) is to keep executing
inline in that case. Based on the experience that silently changing
contexts within a coroutine frequently causes bugs it seems failing
to compile is preferable.

Failing to construct the scheduler used by a coroutine with the
`scheduler` obtained from the receiver is likely an error and should
be addressed by the user appropriately. Failing to compile is seems
to be a reasonable approach in that case, too.

It should be possible to avoid scheduler affinity explicitly to
avoid the cost of scheduling. Users should be very careful when
pursuing this direction but it can be a valid option. One way to
achieve that is to create an "inline scheduler" which immediately
completes when it is `start()`ed and using this type for the
coroutine. Explicitly providing a type `inline_scheduler` implementing
this logic could allow creating suitable warnings. It would also
allow detecting that type in `await_transform` and avoiding the use
of `continues_on` entirely.

When operations actually don't change the scheduler there shouldn't
be a need to schedule them again. In these cases it would be great
if the `continues_on` could be avoided. At the moment there is no
way to tell whether a sender will complete inline. Using a sender
query which determines whether a sender always completes inline could
avoid the rescheduling. Something like that is implemented for
[`unifex`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex):
senders define a property `blocking` which can have the value
`blocking_kind::always_inline`.  The proposal [A sender query for
completion behaviour](https://wg21.link/P3206) proposes a
`get_completion_behaviour(sndr, env)` customisation point to address
this need. The result can indicate that the `sndr` returns synchronously
(using `completion_behaviour::synchronous` or
`completion_behaviour::inline_completion`). If `sndr` returns synchronously
there isn't a need to reschedule it.

In some situations it is desirable to explicitly switch to a different
scheduler from within the coroutine and from then on carry on using
this scheduler.
[`unifex`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex) detects
the use of `co_await schedule(scheduler);` for this purpose. That is,
however, somewhat subtle. It may be reasonable to use a dedicated
awaiter for this purpose and use, e.g.

```c++
auto previous = co_await co_continue_on(new_scheduler);
```

Using this statement replaces the coroutine's scheduler with the
`new_scheduler`. When the `co_await` completes it is on `new_scheduler`
and further `co_await` operations complete on `new_scheduler`. The
result of `co_await`ing `co_continue_on` is the previously used
scheduler to allow transfer back to this scheduler. In
[stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec) the corresponding
operation is called `reschedule_coroutine`.

Another advantage of scheduling the operations on a scheduler instead
of immediately continuing on the context where the operation completed
is that it helps with stack overflows: when scheduling on a non-inline
scheduler the call stack is unwound. Without that it may be necessary
to inject scheduling just for the purpose of avoiding stack overflow
when too many operations complete inline.

## Allocator Support

When using coroutines at least the coroutine frame may end up being
allocated on the heap: the [HALO](https://wg21.link/P0981) optimisations
aren't always possible, e.g., when a coroutine becomes a child of
another sender. To control how this allocation is done and to support
environments where allocations aren't possible `task` should have
allocator support. The idea is to pick up on a pair of arguments of
type `std::allocator_arg_t` and an allocator type being passed and use
the corresponding allocator if present. For example:

```c++
struct allocator_aware_context {
    using allocator_type = std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>;
};

template <class...A>
ex::task<int, allocator_aware_context> fun(int value, A&&...) {
    co_return value;
}

int main() {
    // Use the coroutine without passing an allocator:
    ex::sync_wait(fun(17));

    // Use the coroutine with passing an allocator:
    using allocator_type = std::pmr::polymorphic_alloctor<std::byte>;
    ex::sync_wait(fun(17, std::allocator_arg, allocator_type()));
}
```

The arguments passed when creating the coroutine are made available
to an `operator new` of the promise type, i.e., this operator can
extract the allocator, if any, from the list of parameters and use
that for the purpose of allocation. The matching `operator delete`
gets passed only the pointer to release and the originally requested
`size`. To have access to the correct allocator in `operator delete`
the allocator either needs to be stateless or a copy needs to be accessible
via the pointer passed to `operator delete`, e.g., stored at the
offset `size`.

To avoid any cost introduced by type erasing an allocator
type as part of the `task` definition the expected allocator type
is obtained from the context argument `C` of `task<T, C>`:

```c++
using allocator_type = ex::allocator_of_t<C>;
```

This `using` alias uses `typename C::allocator_type` if present or
defaults to `std::allocator<std::byte>` otherwise.  This
`allocator_type` has to be for the type `std::byte` (if necessary
it is possible to relax that constraint).

The allocator used for the coroutine frame should also be used for
any other allocators needed for the coroutine itself, e.g., when
type erasing something needed for its operation (although in most
cases a small object optimisation would be preferable and sufficient).
Also, the allocator should be made available to child operations
via the respective receiver's environment using the `get_allocator`
query. The arguments passed to the coroutine are also available to
the constructor of the promise type (if there is a matching on) and
the allocator can be obtained from there:

```c++
struct allocator_aware_context {
    using allocator_type = pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>;
};
fixed_resource<2048> resource;

ex::sync_wait([](auto&&, auto* resource)
        -> ex::task<void, allocator_aware_context> {
    auto alloc = co_await ex::read_env(ex::get_allocator);
    use(alloc);
}(allocator_arg, &resource));
```

## Environment Support

When `co_await`ing child operations these may want to access an
environment. Ideally, the coroutine would expose the environment
from the receiver it gets `connect`ed to. Doing so isn't directly
possible because the coroutine types doesn't know about the receiver
type which in turn determines the environment type. Also, the
queries don't know the type they are going to return. Thus, some
extra mechanisms are needed to provide an environment.

A basic environment can be provided by some entities already known
to the coroutine, though:

- The `get_scheduler` query should provide the scheduler maintained
    for [scheduler affinity](#scheduler-affinity) whose type is
    determined based on the coroutine's context using
    `ex::scheduler_of_t<C>`.
- The `get_allocator` query should provide the
    [coroutine's allocator](#allocator-support) whose type is
    determined based on the coroutine's context using `ex::allocator_of_t<C>`.
    The allocator gets initialised when constructing the promise type.
- The `get_stop_token` query should provide a stop token
    from a stop source which is linked to the stop token obtained
    from the receiver's environment. The type of the stop source
    is determined from the coroutine's context using
    `ex::stop_source_of_t<C>` and defaults to `ex::inplace_stop_source`.
    Linking the stop source can be delayed until the first stop
    token is requested or omitted entirely if `stop_possible()`
    returns `false` or if the stop token type of the coroutine's
    receiver matches that of `ex::stop_source_of_t<C>`.

For any other environment query the context `C` of `task<T, C>` can
be used. The coroutine can maintain an instance of type `C`. In many
cases queries from the environment of the coroutine's `receiver` need
to be forwarded. Let `env` be `get_env(receiver)` and `Env`
be the type of `env`.  `C` gets optionally constructed
with access to the environment:

 1. If `C::env_type<Env>` is a valid type the coroutine
    state will contain an object `own_env` of this type which is
    constructed with `env`. The object `own_env` will live at least
    as long as the `C` object maintained and `C` is constructed
    with a reference to `own_env`, allowing `C` to reference type-erased
    representations for query results it needs to forward.
 2. Otherwise, if `C(env)` is valid the `C` object is constructed
    with the result of `get_env(receiver)`. Constructing the context
    with the receiver's environment provides the opportunity to
    store whatever data is needed from the environment to later
    respond to queries as well.
 3. Otherwise, `C` is default constructed. This option typically
    applies if `C` doesn't need to provide any environment queries.

Any query which isn't provided by the coroutine but is available
from the context `C` is forwarded. Any other query shouldn't be
part of the overload set.

For example:

```c++
struct context {
    int value{};
    int query(get_value_t const&) const noexcept { return this->value; }
    context(auto const& env): value(get_value(env)) {}
};

int main() {
    ex::sync_wait(
        ex::write_env(
            []->demo::task<void, context> {
                auto sched(co_await ex::read_env(get_scheduler));
                auto value(co_await ex::read_env(get_value));
                std::cout << "value=" << value << "\n";
                // ...
            }(),
            ex::make_env(get_value, 42)
        )
    );
}
```

## Support For Requesting Cancellation/Stopped

When a coroutine task executes the actual work it may listen to
a stop token to recognise that it got canceled. Once it recognises
that its work should be stopped it should also complete with
`set_stopped(rcvr)`. There is no special syntax needed as that is the
result of using `just_stopped()`:

```c++
co_await ex::just_stopped();
```

The sender `just_stopped()` completes with `set_stopped()` causing
the coroutine to be canceled. Any other sender completing with
`set_stopped()` can also be used.

## Error Reporting

The sender/receiver approach to error reporting is for operations
to complete with a call to `set_error(rcvr, err)` for some receiver
object `rcvr` and an error value `err`. The details of the completions
are used by algorithms to decide how to proceed. For example, if
any of the senders of `when_all(sndr...)` fails with a `set_error_t`
completion the other senders are stopped and the overall operation
fails itself forwarding the first error. Thus, it should be possible
for coroutines to complete with a `set_error_t` completion. Using a
`set_value_t` completion using an error value isn't quite the same
as these are not detected as errors by algorithms.

The error reporting used for
[`unifex`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex) and
[stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec) is to turn an exception
escaping from the coroutine into a `set_error_t(std::exception_ptr)`
completion: when `unhandled_exception()` is called on the promise
type the coroutine is suspended and the function can just call
`set_value(r, std::get_current_exception())`. There are a few
limitations with this approach:

1. The only supported error completion is `set_error_t(std::exception_ptr)`.
    While the thrown exception can represent any error type and
    `set_error_t` completions from `co_await`ed operations resulting
    in the corresponding error being thrown it is better if the
    other error types can be reported, too.
2. To report an error an exception needs to be thrown. In some
    environments it is preferred to not throw exception or exceptions
    may even be entirely banned or disabled which means that there
    isn't a way to report errors from coroutines unless a different
    mechanism is provided.
3. To extract the actual error information from `std::exception_ptr`
    the exception has to be rethrown.
4. The completion signatures for `task<T, C>` necessarily contain
    `set_error_t(std::exception_ptr)` which is problematic when
    exceptions are unavailable: `std::exception_ptr` may also be
    unavailable. Also, without exception as it is impossible to
    decode the error. It can be desirable to have coroutine which
    don't declare such a completion signature.

Before going into details on how errors can be reported it is
necessary to provide a way for `task<T, C>` to control the error
completion signatures.  Similar to the return type the error types
cannot be deduced from the coroutine body. Instead, they can be
declared using the context type `C`:

- If present, `typename C::error_signatures` is used to declare the
    error types. This type needs to be a specialisation of
    `completion_signatures` listing the valid `set_error_t`
    completions.
- If this nested type is not present,
    `completion_signatures<set_error_t(std::exception_ptr)>` is
    used as a default.

The name can be adjusted and it would be possible to use a different
type list template and listing the error types. The basic idea would
remain the same, i.e., the possible error types are declared via the
context type.

Reporting an error by having an exception escape the coroutine is
still possible but it doesn't necessarily result in a `set_error_t`:
If an exception escapes the coroutine and `set_error_t(std::exception_ptr)`
isn't one of the supported the `set_error_t` completions,
`std::terminate()` is called. If an error is explicitly reported
somehow, e.g., using one of the approaches described below,
and the error type isn't supported by the context's `error_signatures`, the program is ill-formed.

The discussion below assumes the use of the class template `with_error<E>`
to indicate that the coroutine completed with an error. It can be as
simple as

```c++
template <class E> struct with_error{ E error; };
```

The name can be different although it shouldn't collide with already
use names (like `error_code` or `upon_error`). Also, in some cases
there isn't really a need to wrap the error into a recognisable
class template. Using a marker type probably helps with readability
and avoiding ambiguities in other cases.

Besides exceptions there are three possible ways how a coroutine
can be exited:

1. The coroutine is exited when using `co_return`, optionally
    with an argument. Flowing off the end of a coroutine is equivalent
    to explicitly using `co_return;` instead of flowing off. It
    would be possible to turn the use of

    ```c++
    co_return with_error{err};
    ```

    into a `set_error(std::move(rcvr), err)` completion.

    One restriction with this approach is that for a
    `task<void, C>` the body can't contain `co_return with_error{e};`: the
    `void` result requires that the promise type contains a function
    `return_void()` and if that is present it isn't possible to
    also have a `return_value(T)`.

2. When a coroutine uses `co_await a;` the coroutine is in a suspended
    state when `await_suspend(...)` of some awaiter is entered.
    While the coroutine is suspended it can be safely destroyed. It
    is possible to complete the coroutine in that state and have the
    coroutine be cleaned up. This approach is used when the awaited
    operation completes with `set_stopped()`. It is possible to
    call `set_error(std::move(rcvr), err)` for some receiver `rcvr`
    and error `err` obtained via the awaitable `a`. Thus, using

    ```c++
    co_await with_error{err};
    ```

    could complete with `set_error(std::move(rcvr), err)`.

    Using the same notation for awaiting outstanding operations and
    returning results from a coroutine is, however, somewhat
    surprising. The name of the awaiter may need to become more
    explicit like `exist_coroutine_with_error` if this approach should
    be supported.

3. When a coroutine uses `co_yield v;` the promise member
    `yield_value(T)` is called which can return an awaiter `a`.
    When `a`'s `await_suspend()` is called, the coroutine is suspended
    and the operation can complete accordingly. Thus, using

    ```c++
    co_yield with_error{err};
    ```

    could complete with `set_error(std::move(rcvr), err)`. Using
    `co_yield` for the purpose of returning from a coroutine with
    a specific result seems more expected than using `co_await`.

There are technically viable options for returning an error from a
coroutine without requiring exceptions. Whether any of them is
considered suitable from a readability point of view is a separate
question.

One concern which was raised with just not resuming the coroutine
is that the time of destruction of variables used by the coroutine
is different. The promise object can be destroyed before completing
which might address the concern.

Using `co_await` or `co_yield` to propagate error results out of
the coroutine has a possibly interesting variation: in both of these
case the error result may be conditionally produced, i.e., it is
possible to complete with an error sometimes and to produce a value
at other times. That could allow a pattern (using `co_yield` for the
potential error return):

```c++
auto value = co_yield when_error(co_await into_expected(sender));
```

The subexpression `into_expected(sender)` could turn the `set_value_t`
and `set_error_t` into a suitable `std::expected<V, std::variant<E...>>`
always reported using a `set_value_t` completion (so the `co_await`
doesn't throw). The corresponding `std::expected` becomes the result
of the `co_await`. Using `co_yield` with `when_error(exp)` where `exp`
is an expected can then either produce `exp.value()` as the result
of the `co_yield` expression or it can result in the coroutine
completing with the error from `exp.error()`.  Using this approach
produces a fairly compact approach to propagating the error retaining
the type and without using exceptions.

## Avoiding Stack Overflow

It is easy to use a coroutine to accidentally create a stack overflow
because loops don't really execute like loops. For example, a
coroutine like this can easily result in a stack overflow:

```c++
ex::sync_wait(ex::write_env(
    []() -> ex::task<void> {
        for (int i{}; i < 1000000; ++i)
            co_await ex::just(i);
    }(),
    ex::make_env(ex::get_scheduler, ex::inline_scheduler{})
));
```

The reason this innocent looking code creates a stack overflow is
that the use of `co_await` results in some function calls to suspend
the coroutine and then further function calls to resume the coroutine
(for a proper explanation see, e.g., Lewis Baker's
[Understanding Symmetric Transfer](https://lewissbaker.github.io/2020/05/11/understanding_symmetric_transfer)).
As a result, the stack grows with each iteration of the loop until
it eventually overflows.

With senders it is also not possible to use symmetric transfer to
combat the problem: to achieve the full generality and composing
senders, there are still multiple function calls used, e.g., when
producing the completion signal. Using `get_completion_behaviour`
from the proposal [A sender query for completion behaviour](https://wg21.link/P3206)
could allow detecting senders which complete synchronously. In these
cases the stack overflow could be avoided relying on symmetric transfer.

When using scheduler affinity the transfer of control via a scheduler
which doesn't complete immediately does avoid the risk of stack
overflow: even when the `co_await`ed work immediately completes as
part of the `await_suspend` call of the created awaiter the coroutine
isn't immediately resumed. Instead, the work is scheduled and the
coroutine is suspended. The thread unwinds its stack until it
reaches its own scheduling and picks up the next entity to execute.

When using `sync_wait(sndr)` the `run_loop`'s scheduler is used and
it may very well just resume the just suspended coroutine: when
there is scheduling happening as part of scheduler affinity it
doesn't mean that work gets scheduled on a different thread!

The problem with stack overflows does remain when the work resumes
immediately despite using scheduler affinity. That may be the case
when using an inline scheduler, i.e., a scheduler with an operation
state whose `start()` immediately completes: the scheduled work gets
executed as soon as `set_value(std::move(rcvr))` is called.

Another potential for stack overflows is when optimising the behaviour
for work which is known to not move to another scheduler: in that case
there isn't really any need to use `continue_on` to get back to the
scheduler where the operation was started! The execution remained
on that scheduler all along. However, not rescheduling the work
means that the stack isn't unwound.

Since `task` uses scheduler affinity by default, stack overflow
shouldn't be a problem and there is no separate provision required
to combat stack overflow. If the implementation chooses to avoid
rescheduling work it will need to make sure that doing so doesn't
cause any problems, e.g., by rescheduling the work sometimes. When
using an inline scheduler the user will need to be very careful to
not overflow the stack or cause any of the various other problems
with executing immediately.

## Asynchronous Clean-Up

Asynchronous clean-up of objects is an important facility. Both
[`unifex`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex) and
[stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec) provide some facilities
for asynchronous clean-up in their respective coroutine task. Based
on the experience the recommendation is to do something different!

The recommended direction is to support asynchronous resources
independent of a coroutine task. For example the
[async-object](https://wg21.link/p2849) proposal is in this direction.
There is similar work ongoing in the context of
[Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly). Thus, there is currently
no plan to support asynchronous clean-up as part of the `task`
implementation.  Instead, it can be composed based on other facilities.

# Caveats

The use of coroutines introduces some issues which are entirely
independent of how specific coroutines are defined. Some of these
were brought up on prior discussions but they aren't anything which
can be solved as part of any particular coroutine implementation.
In particular:

1. As `co_await`ing the result of an operation (or `co_yield`ing a
    value) may suspend a coroutine, there is a potential to
    introduce problems when resources which are meant to be held temporarily
    are held when suspending. For example, holding a lock to a mutex
    while suspending a coroutine can result in a different thread
    trying to release the lock when the coroutine is resumed
    (scheduler affinity will move the resumed coroutine
    to the same scheduler but not to the same thread).
2. Destroying a coroutine is only safe when it is suspended. For
    the task implementation that means that it shall only call a
    completion handler once the coroutine is suspended. That part
    is under the control of the coroutine implementation. However,
    there is no way to guard against users explicitly destroying a
    coroutine from within its implementation or from another thread
    while it is not suspended: that's akin to destroying an object
    while it being used.
3. Debugging asynchronous code doesn't work with the normal approaches:
    there is generally no suitable stack as work gets resumed from
    some run loop which doesn't tell what set up the original work.
    To improve on this situation, _async stack traces_ linking
    different pieces of outstanding work together can help. At
    [CppCon 2024](https://cppcon.org/cppcon-2024-timeline/) Ian
    Petersen and Jessica Wong presented how that may work ([watch
    the video](https://youtu.be/nHy2cA9ZDbw?si=RDFty43InNoJxJNN)).
    Implementations should consider adding corresponding support
    and enhance tooling, e.g., debuggers, to pick up on async stack
    traces. However, async stack support itself isn't really something
    which one coroutine implementation can enable.

While these issues are important this proposal isn't the right place
to discuss them. Discussion of these issues should be delegated
to suitable proposals wanting to improve this situation in some
form.

# Questions

This section lists questions based on the design discussion
above. Each one has a recommendation and a vote is only needed
if there opinions deviating from the recommendation.

- Result type: expand `as_awaitable(sndr)` to support more than
    one `set_value_t(T...)` completion? Recommendation: no.
- Result type: add transformation algorithms like `into_optional`,
    `into_expected`? Recommendation: no, different proposals.
- Scheduler affinity: should `task` support scheduler affinity?
    Recommendation: yes.
- Scheduler affinity: require a `get_scheduler()` query on the
    receiver's environments? Recommendation: yes.
- Scheduler affinity: add a definition for `inline_scheduler`
    (using whatever name) to support disabling scheduler affinity?
    Recommendation: yes.
- Allocator support: should `task` support allocators (default
    `std::allocator<std::byte>`)? Recommendation: yes.
- Error reporting: should it be possible to return an error
    without throwing an exception? Recommendation: yes.
- Error reporting: how should errors be reported? Recommendation:
    using `co_yield with_error(e).
- Error reporting: should `co_yield when_error(expected)` be
    supported? Recommendation: yes (although weakly).
- Clean-up: should asynchronous clean-up be supported? Recommendation:
    no.

# Implementation

An implementation of `task` as proposed in this document is available
from [`beman::task`](https://github.com/bemanproject/task). This
implementation hasn't received much use, yet, as it is fairly new. It
is setup to be buildable and provides some examples as a starting
point for experimentation.

Coroutine tasks very similar although not identical to the one
proposed are used in multiple projects. In particular, there are
three implementations in wide use:

- [`Folly::Task`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/coro/Task.h)
- [`unifex::Task`](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex/blob/main/include/unifex/task.hpp)
- [`stdexec::task`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec/blob/main/include/exec/task.hpp)

The first one
([`Folly::Task`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/coro/Task.h))
isn't based on sender/receiver. Usage experience from all three
have influenced the design of `task`.

::: draftnote
Evertyhing below is text meant to go to the end of the [exec]{.sref}
section without any color highlight of what it being added.
:::

## `execution::affine_on` [exec.affine.on]

[1]{.pnum} `affine_on` adapts a sender into one that completes on
   the specified scheduler. If the algorithm determines that the
   adapted sender already completes on the correct scheduler it is
   allowed to avoid any scheduling operation.

[2]{.pnum} The name `affine_on` denotes a pipeable sender adaptor
    object. For subexpressions `sch` and `sndr`, if `decltype((sch))`
    does not satisfy `scheduler`, or `decltype((sndr))` does not
    satisfy `sender`, `affine_on(sndr, sch)` is ill-formed.

[3]{.pnum} Otherwise, the expression `affine_on(sndr, sch)` is
    expression-equivalent to:

```cpp
    transform_sender(@_get-domain-early_@(sndr), @_make-sender_@(affine_on, sch, sndr))
```

except that `sndr` is evalutated only once.

[4]{.pnum} The exposition-only class template `@_impls-for_@` is specialized
   for `affine_on_t` as follows:

```cpp
  namespace std::execution {
    template <>
    struct @_impls_for_@<affine_on_t>: @_default-impls_@ {
      static constexpr auto @_get-attrs_@ =
        [](const auto& data, const auto& child) noexcept -> decltype(auto) {
          return @_JOIN-ENV_@(_SCHED-ATTRS_@(data), @_FWD-ENV_@(get_env(child)));
        };
    };
  }
```

[5]{.pnum} Let `out_sndr` be a subexpression denoting a sender returned
    from `affine_on(sndr, sch)` or one equal to such, and let
    `OutSndr` be the type `decltype((out_sndr))`. Let `out_rcvr`
    be a subexpression denoting a receiver that has an environment
    of type `Env` such that `sender_in<OutSndr, Env>` is `true`.
    Let `op` be an lvalue referring to the operation state that
    results from connecting `out_sndr` to `out_rcvr`. Calling
    `start(op)` will start `sndr` on the current execution agent
    and execute completion operations on `out_rcvr` on an execution
    agent of the execution resource associated with `sch`. If the
    current execution resource is the same as the execution resource
    associated with `sch` the completion operation on `out_rcvr`
    may be called before `start(op)` completes. If scheduling onto
    `sch` fails, an error completion on `out_rcvr` shall be executed
    on an unspecified execution agent.

## `execution::inline_scheduler` [exec.inline.scheduler]

```cpp
namespace std::execution {
  class inline_scheduler {
    class @_inline-sender_@; // exposition-only
    template <receiver R>
    class @_inline-state_@;  // exposition-only

  public:
    using scheduler_concept = scheduler_t;

    constexpr @_inline-sender_@ schedule() noexcept { return {}; }
    constexpr bool operator== (const inline_scheduler&) const noexcept = default;
  };
}
```

[1]{.pnum} `inline_scheduler` is a class that models `scheduler`
[exec.scheduler]{.sref}. All objects of type `inline_scheduler` are equal.

```cpp
class @_inline-sender_@`
```

[2]{.pnum} `@_inline-sender_@` is an exposition-only type that satisfies
`sender`. For any type `Env`, the type<br/>
`completion_signatures_of_t<@_inline-sender_@, Env>`
is `completion_signatures<set_value_t()>`.

[3]{.pnum} Let `@_sndr_@` be an expression of type `@_inline-sender_@`, let `@_rcvr_@`
be an expression such that `receiver_of<decltype((@_rcvr_@)), CS>` is `true` where
`CS` is `completion_signatures<set_value_t()>`.

- [3.1]{.pnum} The expression `connect(@_sndr_@, @_rcvr_@)` has
    type `@_inline-state_@<remove_cvref_t<@_rcvr_@>>` and is only throwing if
    `((void)@_sndr_@, auto(@_rcvr_@))` is potentially throwing.
- [3.2]{.pnum} The expression `get_completion_scheduler<set_value_t>(get_env(@_sndr_@))`
    has type `inline_scheduler`  and is potentially-throwing if and only if `@_sndr_@` is potentially-throwing.

```cpp
template <receiver R>
class @_inline-state_@;
```

[4]{.pnum} Let `@_o_@` be a non-`const` lvalue of type `@_inline-state_@<Rcvr>`, and
    let `REC(@_o_@)` be a non-`const` lvalue reference to an instance of type `Rcvr`
    that was initialized with the expression `@_rcvr_@` passed to an invocation
    of `connect` that returned `@_o_@`. Then:

- [4.1]{.pnum} The object to which `REC(@_o_@)` refers remains valid for the lifetime
    of the object to which `@_o_@` refers.
- [4.2]{.pnum} The expression `start(@_o_@)` is equivalent to `set_value(std::move(REC(@_o_@)))`.

## `execution::task_scheduler` [exec.task.scheduler]

```cpp
namespace std::execution {
  class task_scheduler {
    class @_sender_@; // exposition-only
    template <receiver R>
    class @_state_@;  // exposition-only

  public:
    using scheduler_concept = scheduler_t;

    template <scheduler Sched, class Allocator = allocator<void>>
      requires(not std::same_as<task_scheduler, std::remove_cvref_t<S>>)
        && scheduler<S>
    explicit task_scheduler(Sched&& sched, Allocator alloc = {});
    template <class Allocator>
    task_scheduler(const task_scheduler& other, Allocator alloc);
    task_scheduler(const task_scheduler& other);
    task_scheduler& operator=(const task_scheduler& other);

    @_sender_@ schedule();
    bool operator== (const task_scheduler&) const noexcept;
    template <class Sched>
      requires (not same_as<task_scheduler, remove_cvref_t<Sched>>)
      && scheduler<Sched>
    bool operator== (const Sched& sched) const noexcept;
  };
}
```

[1]{.pnum} `task_scheduler` is a class that models `scheduler`
    [exec.scheduler]{.sref}. Let `s` be an object of type `task_scheduler`
    then `@_SCHED_@(s)` is an object of a type different than `task_scheduler`
    modeling `scheduler` which is used by `s` to do the actual scheduling.

```cpp
template <scheduler Sched, class Allocator = allocator<void>>
  requires(not same_as<task_scheduler, remove_cvref_t<S>>) && scheduler<S>
explicit task_scheduler(Sched&& sched, Allocator alloc = {});
```

[2]{.pnum} _Effects_: Initialises the object from `sched` and `alloc`.
    Allocations, if any, use `alloc` to get memory.

[3]{.pnum} _Post Condition_: `@_SCHED_@(*this) == sched` is true.

```cpp
template <class Allocator>
task_scheduler(const task_scheduler& other, Allocator alloc);
```

[4]{.pnum} _Effects_: Initialises the object from `other` and `alloc`.
    Any allocation used by `this` use an allocator obtained by rebinding
    `alloc` or a copy thereof.

[5]{.pnum} _Post Condition_: `*this == other` is true.

```cpp
task_scheduler(const task_scheduler& other);
```

[6]{.pnum} _Effects_: equivalent to `task_scheduler(other, allocator<void>{});

```cpp
task_scheduler& operator=(const task_scheduler& other);
```

[7]{.pnum} _Post Condition_: `*this == other` is true.

```cpp
@_sender_@ schedule();
```

[8]{.pnum} _Effects_: Creates a `@_sender_@` initialized with
    `schedule(@_SCHED_@(*this))`.

```cpp
bool operator== (const task_scheduler& other) const noexcept;
```

[9]{.pnum} _Returns_: `false` if the types of `@_SCHED_@(*this)` and `@_SCHED_@(other)` are
    different, otherwise `@_SCHED_@(*this) == @_SCHED_@(other);`

```cpp
template <class Sched>
  requires (not same_as<task_scheduler, remove_cvref_t<Sched>>)
        && scheduler<Sched>
bool operator== (const Sched& other) const noexcept;
```

[10]{.pnum} _Returns_: `false` if the types of `@_SCHED_@(*this)` and `other` are
    different, otherwise `@_SCHED_@(*this) == other;`

```cpp
class task_scheduler::@_sender_@ {
public:
  using sender_concept = sender_t;

  template <receiver R>
  @_state_@<R> connect(R&& rcvr);
};
```

[11]{.pnum} `@_sender_@` is an exposition-only class that models `sender` [exec.sender]{.sref}.
    For any type `Env`, the type `completion_signatures_t<@_sender_@, Env>` is

```cpp
completion_signatures<
  set_value_t(),
  set_error_t(error_code),
  set_error_t(exception_ptr),
  set_stopped_t()>
```

[12]{.pnum} Let `sched` be an object of type `task_scheduler` and
    let `sndr` be an object of type `@_sender_@` obtained from
    `schedule(sched)`. Then
    `get_completion_scheduler<set_value_t>(get_env(sndr)) == sched`
    is true. The object `@_SENDER_@(sched)` is the object initialized
    with `schedule(sched)` or an object move constructed from
    that.

```cpp
template<receiver R>
task_scheduler::@_state_@<R> task_scheduler::@_sender_@::connect(R&& rcvr);
```

[13]{.pnum} _Effects_: Creates a `@_sender_@<R>` initialized with
    `connect(@_SENDER_@(*this), std::forward<R>(rcvr))`.

```cpp
template <receiver R>
class task_scheduler::@_state_@ {
public:
  using operation_state_concept = operation_state_t;

  void start() & noexcept;
};
```

[14]{.pnum} `@_state_@` is an exposition-only class tmplate whose specializations
    model `operation_state` [exec.opstate]{.sref}. Let `R` be a type that models
    `receiver`, let `rcvr` be an object of type`R`, [exec.recv]{.sref},
    and let `st` be an object of type `@_state_@<R>`. `@_STATE_@(st)` is the object
    the object `st` got intialised with.

```cpp
void task_scheduler::@_state_@<R>::start() & noexcept;
```

[15]{.pnum} _Effects_: Equivalent to `start(@_STATE_@(*this))`.

## `execution::task` [exec.task]

### `task` Overview [task.overview]

[1]{.pnum} The `task` class template represents a sender used to `co_await` awaitables by
evaluating a coroutine. The first template parameter `T` defines the type which
can be used with `co_return` and which becomes the `set_value_t(T)` completion.
The second template parameter `Environment` is used to specify various customisations
supported by the `task` class template. The type `task<T, Environment>` models `sender`
[exec.snd]{.sref}

### Class template task [task.class]

```cpp
namespace std::execution {
  template <class T, class Environment>
  class task {
    // [task.state]
    template <receiver R>
    class @_state_@; // @_exposition only_@

  public:
    using sender_concept = sender_t;
    using completion_signatures = @_see below_@;

    // [task.promise]
    class promise_type;

    task(task&&) noexcept;
    ~task();

    template <receiver R>
    @_state_@<R> connect(R&& recv);

  private:
    coroutine_handle<promise_type> @_handle_@; // @_exposition only_@
  };
}
```

[1]{.pnum} The `task` template determines multiple types based on the `Environment` parameter:

- [1.1]{.pnum} If the type `Environment::allocator_type` exists let `Alloc` be that type,
    otherwise let `Alloc` be `allocator<byte>`.
- [1.2]{.pnum} If the type `Environment::scheduler_type` exists let `Scheduler` be that
    type, otherwise let `Scheduler` be `task_scheduler`.
- [1.3]{.pnum} If the type `Environment::stop_source_type` exists let `StopSource` be that
    type, otherwise let `StopSource` be `inplace_stop_source`.
- [1.4]{.pnum} If the type `Environment::error_types` exists let `Errors`
    be that type, otherwise let `Errors` be
    `completion_signatures<set_error_t(exception_ptr)>` if the
    implementation supports exceptions, otherwise let `Errors` be
    `completion_signatures<>`.  `Errors` must be a
    specialization<br/>`completion_signatures<ErrorSig...>` where
    each element of `ErrorSig...` is of the form `set_error_t(E)`
    for some type `E`.

[2]{.pnum} The type alias `task<T, Environment>::completion_signatures`
    is a specialization of `excution::completion_signatures` with
    the template arguments `set_value_t(T)`, `ErrorSig...`, and
    `set_stopped_t()` in an unspecified order.

[3]{.pnum} _Mandates_: `Alloc` shall meet the _Cpp17Allocator_ requirements.

### Task Members [task.members]

```cpp
task(task&& other) noexcept;
```

[1]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Initializes `@_handle_@` with `exchange(other.@_handle_@, {})`.

```cpp
~task();
```

[2]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Equivalent to:

```cpp
    if (@_handle_@)
      @_handle_@.destroy();
```

```cpp
template <receiver R>
@_state_@<R> connect(R&& recv);
```

[3]{.pnum} _Precondition_ `bool(@_handle_@)` is true.

[4]{.pnum} _Returns:_ `@_state_@<R>{ exchange(@_handle_@, {}), forward<R>(recv) };`

### Class template task::state [task.state]

```cpp
namespace std::execution {
  template <class T, class Environment>
    template <receiver R>
  class task<T, Environment>::@_state_@ { // @_exposition only_@
  public:
    using operation_state_concept = operation_state_t;

    coroutine_handle<promise_type> @_handle_@;  // @_exposition only_@
    remove_cvref_t<R>              @_rcvr_@;    // @_exposition only_@
    @_see below_@                      @_own-env_@; // @_exposition only_@
    Environment                    @_environment_@; // @_exposition only_@

    template <class RCVR>
    @_state_@(coroutine_handle<promise_type> h, RCVR&& rr);
    ~@_state_@();
    void start() & noexcept;
    const Environment& @_get-environment_@() const noexcept; // @_exposition only_@
  };
}
```

[1]{.pnum} Let `Env` be the type of the receiver's environment
    `decltype(get_env(declval<R>()))`. The type of `@_env_@` is
    `Environment::template env_type<Env>` if this type is valid and
    `empty_env` otherwise.

```cpp
template <class RCVR>
@_state_@(coroutine_handle<promise_type> h, RCVR&& rr);
```

[2]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Initializes `@_handle_@` with `std::move(h)`
    and `@_rcvr_@` with `std::forward<RCVR>(rr)`. `@_own-env_@` is
    initialised with `get_env(@_rcvr_@)` if that initialisation
    is valid and default constructed otherwise. `@_environment_@` is
    initialised with `@_own-env_@` if that initialisation is
    valid, otherwise, it is initalised with `get_env(@_rcvr_@)`
    if this initialisation is valid, otherwise it is default
    constructed.

```cpp
~@_state_@();
```

[3]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Equivalent to

```cpp
    if (@_handle_@)
      @_handle_@.destroy();
```

```cpp
void start() & nexcept;
```

[4]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Let `prom` be the object `@_handle_@.promise()`.
    The object `prom` is set up to refer to `*this`:

- [4.1]{.pnum} `@_STATE_@(prom)` is `*this` (see [task.promise]).
- [4.2]{.pnum} `@_RCVR_@(prom)` is `@_rcvr_@`.
- [4.3]{.pnum} `@_SCHED_@(prom)` is initialised using
    `Scheduler(get_scheduler(get_env(@_rcvr_@)))` if that expression is
    valid and using `Scheduler()` otherwise. If neither of these
    expressions is valid, the program is ill-formed.
- [4.4]{.pnum} `prom.@_source_@` and `prom.@_token_@` are set up
    such that `prom.@_token_@` reflects the state of
    `get_stop_token(get_env(@_rcvr_@))`.

[1]{.pnum} Let `prom` be an object of `promise_type` and let `tsk`
    be the `task` object created by `prom.get_return_object()`. The
    description below refers to objects associated with `prom` whose
    dynamic type isn't known using a notation which still just
    accesses them.  [An implementation could, e.g., use
    dispatching through a base class to implement the neccessary
    accesses.]{.note}

- [1.1]{.pnum} `@_STATE_@(prom)` is the operation state object used to
    resume the `task` coroutines.
- [1.2]{.pnum} `@_RCVR_@(prom)` is an object initialised from `rcvr`
    where `rcvr` is the receiver used to get `@_STATE_@(prom)` by using
    `connect(tsk, rcvr)`.
- [1.3]{.pnum} `@_SCHED_@(prom)` is an object of type `Scheduler` which
    is associated with `prom`.
- [1.4] `ErrorVariant` is a `variant<remove_cvref_t<E>...>`, with duplicate
    types removed, where `E...` are the parameter types of the
    elements in `Errors`.

```cpp
template <class... Args>
promise_type(const Args&... args);
```

[2]{.pnum} _Effects:_ If `Args` contains an element of type
    `allocator_arg_t` then `@_alloc_@` is initialised with the
    corresponding next element of `args`. Otherwse, `@_alloc_@`
    is initialised with `Alloc()`.

```cpp
task get_return_object() noexcept;
```

[3]{.pnum} _Returns:_ A `task` object whose member `@_handle_@` is
    `coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(*this)`.

```cpp
auto initial_suspend() noexcept;
```

[4]{.pnum} _Returns:_ An awaitable object of unspecified type
    ([expr.await]) whose member functions arrange for the calling
    coroutine to be suspended. The awaitable also arranges for
    the coroutine to be resumed on an execution resource matching
    `@_SCHED_@(*this)`.

```cpp
auto final_suspend() noexcept;
```

[5]{.pnum} _Returns:_ An awaitable object of unspecified type
    ([expr.await]) whose member functions arrange for the calling
    coroutine to be suspended and then for calling `set_value` or
    `set_error` with the appropriate arguments:

- [5.1]{.pnum} If the coroutine exited with an error `e` this error is
    is reported by calling `set_error(std::move(@_RCVR_@(*this), std::move(e))`.
- [5.2]{.pnum} Otherwise, if `same_as<void, T>` is true
    `set_value(std::move(@_RCVR_@(*this)))` is called.
- [5.3]{.pnum} Otherwise, `set_value(std::move(@_RCVR_@(*this)), *@_result_@)`
    is called.

```cpp
template <class Err>
auto yield_value(with_error<Err> err);
```

[6]{.pnum} _Mandates_ The type `Err` is unambigiously convertible to
    one of the `set_error_t` argument types of `Errors`.

[7]{.pnum} _Returns:_ An awaitable object of unspecified type
    ([expr.await]) whose member functions arrange for the calling
    coroutine to be suspended and then for calling
    `set_error(std::move(@_RCVR_@(*this), std::move(err.error)))`.

```cpp
template <sender Sender>
auto await_transform(Sender&& sndr) noexcept;
```

[8]{.pnum} _Returns_: If `same_as<inline_scheduler, Scheduler>` is
    true returns `as_awaitable(std::forward<Sender>(sndr), *this)`;
    otherwise returns
    `as_awaitable(affine_on(std::forward<Sender>(sndr), @_SCHED_@(*this)), *this)`.

```cpp
auto await_transform(change_coroutine_scheduler<Scheduler> s) noexcept;
```

[9]{.pnum} _Returns:_ `as_awaitable(just(exchange(@_SCHED_@(*this), s.scheduler)), *this);`

```cpp
void uncaught_exception();
```

[10]{.pnum} _Effects:_ If the signature `set_error_t(exception_ptr)` is
    not an element of `Errors` calls `terminate()`. Otherwise stores
    `current_exception()` into `@_errors_@`.

```cpp
void unhandled_stopped();
```

[11]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Calls `set_stopped(std::move(@_RCVR_@(*this)))`.

[12]{.pnum} _Returns:_ `noop_coroutine();`

```cpp
@_unspecified_@ get_env() const noexcept;
```

[13]{.pnum} _Returns:_ The member function returns an object `env`
    such that queries are forwarded as follows:

- [13.1]{.pnum} `env.query(get_scheduler)` returns `Scheduler(@_SCHED_@(*this))`.
- [13.2]{.pnum} `env.query(get_allocator)` returns `@_alloc_@`.
- [13.3]{.pnum} `env.query(get_stop_token)` returns `@_token_@`.
- [13.4]{.pnum} For any other query `q` and arguments `a...` a
    call to `env.query(q, a...)` returns
    <br/>`@_STATE_@(*this).@_get-environment_@().query(q, a...)` if this expression
    is well-formed and `forwarding_query(q)` is well-formed.  Otherwise
    `env.query(q, a...)` is ill-formed.

```cpp
template <class... Args>
void* operator new(size_t size, const Args&... args);
```

[13]{.pnum} If there is no parameter with type `allocator_arg_t`
    then let `alloc` be `Allocator()`; otherwise, if there is no
    parameter following the first `allocator_arg_t` parameter then
    the program is ill-formed; otherise, let `arg_next` be the
    parameter following the first `allocator_arg_t` parameter and
    the program is ill-formed if `Allocator(arg_next)` isn't a valid
    expression, otherwise let `alloc` be `Allocator(arg_next)`.
    Let `PAlloc` be `allocator_traits<Allocator>::template rebind_alloc<U>`
    where `U` is an unspecified type whose size and alignmnet are both
    `__STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__`.

[14]{.pnum} _Mandates:_ `allocator_traits<PAlloc>::pointer` is a pointer
    type.

[15]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Initializes an allocator `palloc` of type `PAlloc`
    with `alloc`. Uses `palloc` to allocate storage for the smallest
    array of `U` sufficient to provide stroage for coroutine state
    of size `size`, and unspecified additional state neccessary to
    ensure that `operator delete` can later deallocate this memory
    block with an allocator equal to `palloc`.

[16]{.pnum} _Returns:_ A pointer to the allocated storage.

```cpp
void operator delete(void* pointer, size_t size) noexcept;
```

[17]{.pnum} _Preconditions:_ `pointer` was returned from an invocation
    of the above overload of `operator new` with a size argument
    equal to `size`.

[18]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Deallocates the storage pointed to by `pointer`
    using an allocator equivalent to that used to allocate it.
